# Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is a simulator program designed for Cisco Networking Academy trainers and students to create network topologies and configure the mentioned devices without the need for real Cisco Routers and Switches.

With Packet Tracer, you can work to prepare for the CCNA and CCNA Security exams. In these studies, you can configure Cisco Routers and Switches via CLI (command line interface), and you can see all the details of a package thanks to its advanced simulation features.

With the Packet Tracer version 7.0, you can now use the IoT (Internet of Things) components in the topologies you have prepared.

Packet Tracer allows you to create network topologies by dragging and dropping routers, switches and various other network devices. A physical connection between devices is represented by a "cable" element. Packet Tracer supports basic routing such as RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BDP, as well as a range of application layer protocols to the extent required by the current CCNA curriculum. As of version 5.3, Packet Tracer also supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
